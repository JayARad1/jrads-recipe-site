    <h4>Brief description.</h4>
    <p>These meatballs are easy to make, and don't really
        take too long at all. I developed this recipe on my
        own by experimenting with different cooking methods,
        cooking times and seasonings, until I discovered the
        perfect recipe to my taste.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Minced beef</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce base</li>
        <li>Thin spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Smoked paprika powder</li>
        <li>Grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220 degrees celcius.</li>
        <li>Mix minced meat with all of the seasonings (tbs of each seasoning), 1 egg and 75g of breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Mix 25g of minced meat into a meatball until there is no meat left.</li>
        <li>Place the meatballs onto baking paper, onto a baking tray and place in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Get a pot of water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Grab your desired about of thin spaghetti and place into the put, cook to taste.</li>
        <li>Once your pasta is cooked, place it in a strainer with a very small amount of oil and toss for 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Once meatballs are cooked, take them out of the oven and let them rest for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grab a bowl, put spaghetti into bowl and then put your meatballs on top, top with parmesian cheese.</li>
    </ol>
