    <h4>Brief description.</h4>
    <p>These tacos could be made in your sleep! They're super easy and highly versatile, meaning you can cook as much as
        you desire and
        also change almost every ingredient to your own taste preferences!
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Minced beef</li>
        <li>Taco seasoning</li>
        <li>Salsa</li>
        <li>Grated mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>Whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Soft taco tortillas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice your tomatoes and lettuce to your desired size and put into separate bowls.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan on low-med.</li>
        <li>Place your mince meat into the pan and mix until brown.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, turn the heat to low and pour in your taco mince seasoning with 1/4 cup of water.</li>
        <li>Stir until most of the seasoning has been asorbed by the meat (approx. 5 - 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Pour your minced meat into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>That's basically it! Now you can serve your meat and choice of toppings onto the tortilla. (You can also
            heat up the tortilla in the pan or in a microwave if desired).
    </ol>
