This is my first project for The Odin Project, this project
is a basic website that displays 3 simple recipes; the recipes
must include a photo of the food, an ingredients list (unordered) 
and and instructions list (ordered).

This project will show some basic HTML & Git skills that I have
learned throughout The Odin Project curriculum.
